{2 Gencore Usage Workflows}

{3 Importing Submission Sheets}

Export the google-doc to CSV.

Test the import:
{v
hitscore <profile> pss file.csv
v}

Do the real one (check the run-plan for PhiX spike-in):
{v
hitscore production -wet-run A:1 B:2 pss.csv
v}
{e A:1 B:2} mean that the pool A has 1% PhiX and the pool B 2%.


{3 Hiseq-raw Directories}

As simple as
{v
hitscore production register-hiseq-raw /absolute/path/to/111004_SN911_0079_BD053MACXX/
v}


{3 Demultiplexing}

Choose and Hiseq-raw directory (e.g. from the output of register-hiseq-raw, the
{{:https://gencore.bio.nyu.edu/layout?type=record_hiseq_raw&action=view}/layout}
service, or {e select * in hiseq_raw}, …).

{v
hitscore production bcl-to-fastq start  <nb>
v}

See 
{v
hitscore production bcl-to-fastq start -help
v}
for options (sample-sheet kind, tiles, wall-hours, etc.).

{3 Delivery}

Use the {i custom-query} “{e deliveries}” to know what is available to
deliver, then the command {e deliver} to do the actual links with ACLs.


Example delivering C0HYHACXX:
{v
$ hitscore production Q deliveries  C0HYHACXX
Found 4 invoices:
  10 (to Rockman)
  11 (to Gunsalus)
  12 (to Carlton)
  13 (to Purugganan)
Found 1 bcl-to-fastqs:
  34 (tiles: N/A, result: 111/B2F_C0HYHACXX_2012-03-02_11-11-37.744094_S10_H15_M1_1.8.2_sm4431)
v}

And then for each one needed:
{v
$ hitscore production deliver 34 10 /data/cgsb/gencore/out 2012-02-06
v}

{3 Deleting Intensities}

for now the deletion is manual, but one can register a successful one:
{v
hitscore production delete-intensities register <nb>
v}
where {e <bn>} is an Hiseq-raw directory {e g_id}.
