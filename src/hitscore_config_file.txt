{2 Hitscore configuration file}

The default path is: {e ~/.config/hitscore/config.sexp}, but the {e
hitscore} and {e hitscoreweb} commands can be called with a different
path ({e ':'} is the separator), e.g.:
{[
hitscore myfile.sexp:specialprofile <command> ...
]}

{3 Examples}

This one defines one {i profile} “{e test}”, Hitscore will in that
case use the local/default database of the user:
{[
(profile test
 (root "/home/sm4431/tmp/gencore_extract/gencore/"
  (writers sm4431 root)
  (group admin))
 (raw "/home/sm4431/tmp/gencore_extract/gencore-raw"
  (hiseq "HiSeq"))
 (work "/tmp/zz_hs_work/")
 )
]}

A good configuration file on Bowery would be:
{[
(profile dev 
         (root "/scratch/sm4431/gencore-dev/"
          (writers sm4431 aa144)
          (group cgsb))
 	 (raw "/data/cgsb/gencore-raw"
	  (hiseq "HiSeq"))
         (work "/scratch/sm4431/gencorework-dev/")
          (db 
           (host "pg.bio.nyu.edu")
           (port 5432)
           (database "hitscore-dev")
           (username "hitscore-dev")
           (password "very long secret")))

(profile production 
         (root "/data/cgsb/gencore/"
           (writers sm4431 aa144)
           (group cgsb))
 	 (raw "/data/cgsb/gencore-raw"
	  (hiseq "HiSeq"))
         (work "/scratch/sm4431/gencorework-dev/")
         (work "/scratch/sm4431/gencorework/")
         (db 
          (host "pg.bio.nyu.edu")
          (port 5432)
          (database "hitscore")
          (username "hitscore")
          (password "very long secret")))
]}
