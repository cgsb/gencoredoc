=== Build ===

To build just type:
   make

It assumes that the directories gencoredoc/ hitscore/ sequme/ and
biocaml/ are at the same level and `make doc' has been called on them.

To change those paths, set the variables HITSCORE_DOC, SEQUME_DOC,
and/or BIOCAML_DOC in a file setup.data, e.g.:
  echo 'HITSCORE_DOC = ../../some/special/path/to_hiscore' > setup.data
the makefile will use this.
